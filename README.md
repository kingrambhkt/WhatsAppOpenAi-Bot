## Introduction

OpenAI's GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models have been trained to understand natural language and code. GPTs provide text outputs in response to their inputs. The inputs to GPTs are also referred to as "prompts". Designing a prompt is essentially how you “program” a GPT model, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to successfully complete a task. GPTs can be used across a great variety of tasks including content or code generation, summarization, conversation, creative writing, and more.
