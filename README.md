 ## WhatsApp Bot
This is a source code to build a WhatsApp bot using OpenAI bot and Node.js. The bot is capable of understanding natural language and providing information on various topics. It can be used to answer questions, provide advice, and even have conversations with users. With this source code, you can create a powerful bot that can be used for a variety of purposes. <br> 

NOTE: DON'T EDIT BOT CODES WITHOUT OWNER ACCESS!

## GPTs

OpenAI's GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models have been trained to understand natural language and code. GPTs provide text outputs in response to their inputs. The inputs to GPTs are also referred to as "prompts". Designing a prompt is essentially how you “program” a GPT model, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to successfully complete a task. GPTs can be used across a great variety of tasks including content or code generation, summarization, conversation, creative writing, and more. Read more in our introductory GPT guide and in our GPT best practices guide.

## Embeddings
An embedding is a vector representation of a piece of data (e.g. some text) that is meant to preserve aspects of its content and/or its meaning. Chunks of data that are similar in some way will tend to have embeddings that are closer together than unrelated data. OpenAI offers text embedding models that take as input a text string and produce as output an embedding vector. Embeddings are useful for search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, classification, and more. Read more about embeddings in our embeddings guide.
